MTC and LTC timecode generator library in Java

**NOTE:** The library is still a wip.

## TODO list:
- ALL of the MTC part
- fix audio buffer managment for LTC generator
- Write a timecode reader for both MTC and LTC
- Write a Timecode wrapper that will automatically set framens 'n stuff based of time, speed and direction

### The idea

After searching A LOT for some free and open source LTC libraries for java, I've founded [this one](https://github.com/MrExplode/ltc4j) that sounded interesting. I take a look at the code, and I noticed it wasn't working well + there were a lot of stuff that could be improved. So I decided instead to start from scratch and write my own library that will handle both LTC and MTC, by using some ideas I've found in that library. Also, I've asked [Andrea Colla](https://github.com/AndColla) (A friend of mine) for some help, because, sadly, I'm quite busy rn.
